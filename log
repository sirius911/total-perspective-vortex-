Setting up band-stop filter from 59 - 61 Hz

IIR filter parameters
---------------------
Butterworth bandstop zero-phase (two-pass forward and reverse) non-causal filter:
- Filter order 16 (effective, after forward-backward)
- Cutoffs at 59.35, 60.65 Hz: -6.02, -6.02 dB

Filtering raw data in 1 contiguous segment
Setting up band-pass filter from 7 - 32 Hz

FIR filter parameters
---------------------
Designing a one-pass, zero-phase, non-causal bandpass filter:
- Windowed time-domain design (firwin) method
- Hamming window with 0.0194 passband ripple and 53 dB stopband attenuation
- Lower passband edge: 7.00
- Lower transition bandwidth: 2.00 Hz (-6 dB cutoff frequency: 6.00 Hz)
- Upper passband edge: 32.00 Hz
- Upper transition bandwidth: 8.00 Hz (-6 dB cutoff frequency: 36.00 Hz)
- Filter length: 265 samples (1.656 sec)
